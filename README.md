this project came to mind when using Canva for graphically designing my coconut x graphic design poster. Canva has a color palette generator, which works fine, but not perfectly. I had to pay to create my own color palettes from the pictures I uploaded. So I was like fuck it, I'll create my own, and an even better one. I want to use it to create my own background transitions, using the colors I want and in the proportions that I prefer. So here we go.
